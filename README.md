Tool to convert SimBench data sets to ieÂ³'s power system data model (to be published in near future).
SimBench has been research project of Kassel university, Fraunhofer IEE, RWTH Aachen university and TU Dortmund university, aiming at provision of realistic models of electrical distribution grids including time series.
The data is availabe at https://simbench.de.

There is another conversion tool available [here](https://github.com/e2nIEE/simbench), that makes the models available to the well known [pandapower](https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower) simulation software.
